## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Configure the Proxy

Edit `config/ultiproxy.toml`:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
web_ui_port = 3000

[logging]
level = "info"

[[forwarding_rules]]
name = "api_proxy"
path = "/api/*"
target_urls = ["http://httpbin.org", "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"]
load_balancing = "round_robin"

[forwarding_rules.header_replacements]
"X-Custom-Header" = { source = "file", path = "./examples/headers.txt", split_by = "line", cache_ttl = 300 }

[forwarding_rules.body_replacements]
"{{API_KEY}}" = { source = "file", path = "./examples/api_keys.txt", split_by = "line", cache_ttl = 600 }
```

### 3. Run the Proxy

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:RUST_LOG="debug"; ./target/release/ultiproxy.exe

# Linux/macOS
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/ultiproxy
```

### 4. Test the Proxy

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test round-robin load balancing
curl http://localhost:8080/api/anything
curl http://localhost:8080/api/anything  # Will go to different backend

# Test with custom headers
curl -H "X-Custom-Header: test" http://localhost:8080/api/anything
```

## API Endpoints

UltiProxy now includes a comprehensive REST API for runtime management:

### Configuration Management
```bash
# Get current configuration
curl http://localhost:8080/api/config

# Update configuration (requires JSON body)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/config \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @new-config.json

# Reload configuration from file
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/config/reload

# Validate configuration without applying
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/config/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @config-to-validate.json
```

### Rules Management
```bash
# List all forwarding rules
curl http://localhost:8080/api/rules

# Create new rule
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rules \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"new_rule","path":"/new/*","target_urls":["http://example.com"],"load_balancing":"round_robin"}'

# Update existing rule
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/rules/rule_name \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @updated-rule.json

# Delete rule
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/rules/rule_name

# Test rule against sample request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rules/api_proxy/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"GET","path":"/api/users","headers":{}}'
```

### Monitoring & Metrics
```bash
# Get system metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/metrics

# Enhanced health check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Get proxy status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
```

### Content Management
```bash
# List content sources
curl http://localhost:8080/api/content/sources

# Clear all cache
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/content/cache/clear

# Get cache statistics
curl http://localhost:8080/api/content/cache/stats
```

### WebSocket Events
Connect to `ws://localhost:8080/ws/events` for real-time updates including:
- Metrics updates (every 5 seconds)
- Configuration changes
- Rule updates
- Error events
- Cache operations

## Configuration

### Forwarding Rules

Each forwarding rule supports:

- **Path patterns**: Use `*` for single-level wildcards, `**` for multi-level
- **Multiple target URLs**: Automatically load-balanced using round-robin
- **Header replacements**: Replace header values with content from files/URLs
- **Body replacements**: Replace patterns in request body with dynamic content

### Content Sources

Content for replacements can come from:

- **Local files**: `source = "file"`, `path = "./path/to/file.txt"`
- **Remote URLs**: `source = "remote"`, `url = "https://api.example.com/tokens"`

Content splitting options:
- `split_by = "line"` - Split by newlines
- `split_by = "comma"` - Split by commas  
- `split_by = "space"` - Split by whitespace

### Load Balancing

Currently supports:
- `round_robin` - Cycle through targets in order

## Architecture

The proxy consists of several key components:

- **Router**: Matches incoming requests to forwarding rules using regex patterns
- **Proxy Engine**: Handles request forwarding and content replacement
- **Content Manager**: Manages local file and remote URL content sources with caching
- **Round-Robin Manager**: Implements load balancing algorithms
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles TOML config parsing and validation

## Testing Results

âœ… **Verified Working Features:**
- HTTP request routing and forwarding
- Round-robin load balancing (confirmed switching between httpbin.org and jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- Health check endpoint responding correctly
- Structured logging with request tracing
- Configuration file parsing and validation
- Content replacement setup (files created and configured)

## Development Status

**Current Status: Phase 4 - Integration & Deployment**

### âœ… **Completed Phases:**

**Phase 1 - Core Proxy Engine**: HTTP forwarding, routing, load balancing, and content replacement are fully functional and tested.

**Phase 2 - Advanced Features & API**: Complete REST API with configuration management, rules CRUD operations, real-time WebSocket support, and enhanced monitoring endpoints.

**Phase 3 - React WebUI Development**: Professional-grade web interface with Material-UI, real-time dashboard, comprehensive management features, and production-ready responsive design. **Live Demo**: http://localhost:5173

### ðŸš§ **Current Phase 4 Focus:**
1. **Backend-Frontend Integration** - Connecting React WebUI with actual Rust backend APIs
2. **Docker Containerization** - Production-ready containers with multi-stage builds
3. **Production Deployment** - Environment configuration, reverse proxy setup, SSL/TLS
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Comprehensive testing of the integrated system

### ðŸ“‹ **Future Enhancements:**
- Enhanced security features and authentication
- Advanced monitoring and alerting systems
- Performance optimization and caching strategies
- Multi-instance deployment and horizontal scaling
