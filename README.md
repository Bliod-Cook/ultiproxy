# UltiProxy - HTTP Forwarding Service

A sophisticated HTTP proxy service built in Rust that supports configurable forwarding rules, dynamic content replacement, and round-robin load balancing.

## Features

âœ… **Implemented (Phase 1 - Core Proxy Engine)**
- âœ… HTTP request routing based on path patterns
- âœ… Round-robin load balancing between multiple target URLs
- âœ… TOML configuration file support
- âœ… File-based content replacement sources
- âœ… Header and body content replacement
- âœ… Health check endpoint
- âœ… Structured logging with tracing
- âœ… Graceful shutdown handling

ðŸš§ **In Progress**
- Remote URL content sources (basic implementation done)
- Configuration hot-reload (file watcher implemented)
- WebUI development

ðŸ“‹ **Planned (Future Phases)**
- React-based WebUI for management
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- API endpoints for configuration management
- WebSocket for real-time updates
- Enhanced security features
- Docker containerization

## Quick Start

### 1. Build the Project

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Configure the Proxy

Edit `config/ultiproxy.toml`:

```toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 8080
web_ui_port = 3000

[logging]
level = "info"

[[forwarding_rules]]
name = "api_proxy"
path = "/api/*"
target_urls = ["http://httpbin.org", "http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com"]
load_balancing = "round_robin"

[forwarding_rules.header_replacements]
"X-Custom-Header" = { source = "file", path = "./examples/headers.txt", split_by = "line", cache_ttl = 300 }

[forwarding_rules.body_replacements]
"{{API_KEY}}" = { source = "file", path = "./examples/api_keys.txt", split_by = "line", cache_ttl = 600 }
```

### 3. Run the Proxy

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
$env:RUST_LOG="debug"; ./target/release/ultiproxy.exe

# Linux/macOS
RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/ultiproxy
```

### 4. Test the Proxy

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Test round-robin load balancing
curl http://localhost:8080/api/anything
curl http://localhost:8080/api/anything  # Will go to different backend

# Test with custom headers
curl -H "X-Custom-Header: test" http://localhost:8080/api/anything
```

## Configuration

### Forwarding Rules

Each forwarding rule supports:

- **Path patterns**: Use `*` for single-level wildcards, `**` for multi-level
- **Multiple target URLs**: Automatically load-balanced using round-robin
- **Header replacements**: Replace header values with content from files/URLs
- **Body replacements**: Replace patterns in request body with dynamic content

### Content Sources

Content for replacements can come from:

- **Local files**: `source = "file"`, `path = "./path/to/file.txt"`
- **Remote URLs**: `source = "remote"`, `url = "https://api.example.com/tokens"`

Content splitting options:
- `split_by = "line"` - Split by newlines
- `split_by = "comma"` - Split by commas  
- `split_by = "space"` - Split by whitespace

### Load Balancing

Currently supports:
- `round_robin` - Cycle through targets in order

## Architecture

The proxy consists of several key components:

- **Router**: Matches incoming requests to forwarding rules using regex patterns
- **Proxy Engine**: Handles request forwarding and content replacement
- **Content Manager**: Manages local file and remote URL content sources with caching
- **Round-Robin Manager**: Implements load balancing algorithms
- **Configuration Manager**: Handles TOML config parsing and validation

## Testing Results

âœ… **Verified Working Features:**
- HTTP request routing and forwarding
- Round-robin load balancing (confirmed switching between httpbin.org and jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- Health check endpoint responding correctly
- Structured logging with request tracing
- Configuration file parsing and validation
- Content replacement setup (files created and configured)

## Development Status

This is Phase 1 of the implementation focusing on core proxy functionality. The basic HTTP forwarding, routing, and load balancing features are working correctly. Content replacement and remote sources are implemented but need further testing with appropriate endpoints.

Next phases will focus on:
1. WebUI development (React frontend)
2. API endpoints for runtime configuration
3. Real-time monitoring and metrics
4. Enhanced security and production features
